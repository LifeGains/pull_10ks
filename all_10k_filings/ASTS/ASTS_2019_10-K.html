majority of our independent directors. NASDAQ rules also require that we must complete one or more business combinations having
an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting
commissions and taxes payable) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination.
Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board
of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain
an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions
with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able
to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if
it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty
as to the value of a target&rsquo;s assets or prospects. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way
so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests
or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less
than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team
or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete an initial business combination if the post-transaction
company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest
in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended, or the &ldquo;Investment Company Act&rdquo;. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of
the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority
interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination.
For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding
capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the
issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own
less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity
interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such
business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of NASDAQ&rsquo;s 80% of fair
market value test. If the initial business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of fair market value test
will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial
business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">We believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to
target businesses. As a public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through
a merger or other business combination with us. Following an initial business combination, we believe the target business would
have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders&rsquo;
interests than it would as a private company. A target business can further benefit by augmenting its profile among potential
new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners
of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares of Class A common
stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of our shares of Class A common stock and cash, allowing us to
tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers.</P>

<P STYLE="margin: 0pt 0; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company,
we believe target businesses will find this method a more expeditious and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than
the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than
the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process,
including underwriting discounts and commissions, marketing and road show efforts that may not be present to the same extent in
connection with an initial business combination with us.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">Furthermore, once a proposed initial business combination is completed, the target business
will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters&rsquo; ability to
complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could
have negative valuation consequences. Following an initial business combination, we believe the target business would then have
greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders&rsquo; interests
and the ability to use its shares as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting
a company&rsquo;s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">While we believe that our structure and our management team&rsquo;s backgrounds will
make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as
our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">We are an &ldquo;emerging growth company,&rdquo; as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities
Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements
that are applicable to other public companies that are not &ldquo;emerging growth companies&rdquo; including, but not limited
to, not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirements of Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the &ldquo;Sarbanes-Oxley Act&rdquo;), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation
in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive
compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities
less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may
be more volatile.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an &ldquo;emerging growth
company&rdquo; can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying
with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; can delay the adoption of certain
accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits
of this extended transition period. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal
year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross
revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value
of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on
which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">As of December 31, 2019 we had $223,164,831 held in the trust account, after payment
of $8,050,000 of deferred underwriting fees, in each case before fees and expenses associated with our initial business combination.
With the funds available, we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing
capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt or leverage
ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination
of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration
to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing
and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite
period of time following our initial public offering. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from
the proceeds of our initial public offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants, the proceeds of the sale
of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements
we may enter into following the consummation of our initial public offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the
target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete
our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development
or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or
not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us
from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction
company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to
fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities
in connection with the completion of our initial business combination, and we may effectuate our initial business combination
using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. In addition, we intend to target
businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, and may as a result be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial business combination.
Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the
completion of our initial business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the
trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the initial business combination would disclose
the terms of the financing and, only if required by law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions
on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination. At this time, we
are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through
the sale of securities or otherwise.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Sources of Target Businesses</B></P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">We anticipate that target business candidates will continue to be brought to our attention
from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and investment professionals. Target businesses may be brought
to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings. These sources may also
introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources
will have read this Report or the final prospectus relating to our initial public offering and know what types of businesses we
are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as our sponsor and their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target
business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions
they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of proprietary deal
flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers
and directors and our sponsor and their respective industry and business contacts as well as their affiliates. While we do not
presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions
on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder&rsquo;s
fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm&rsquo;s length negotiation based on the terms
of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities
to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction
that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder&rsquo;s fees is customarily tied to completion
of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event will our sponsor
or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which our sponsor or officers are affiliated, be paid any finder&rsquo;s
fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the company prior to,
or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial
business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). Although none of our sponsor, executive officers or directors,
or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder&rsquo;s fees or consulting fees from
a prospective business combination target in connection with a contemplated initial business combination, we do not have a policy
that prohibits our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement
of out-of-pocket expenses by a target business. We have agreed to pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month
for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses
related to identifying, investigating and completing an initial business combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter
into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our initial business combination. The presence
or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an initial business combination
candidate.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">As required by NASDAQ rules, our initial business combination will be approved by a
majority of our independent directors. NASDAQ rules also require that we must complete one or more business combinations having
an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting
commissions and taxes payable) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination.
The fair market value of our initial business combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more
standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading
multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of M&amp;A transactions of comparable
businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination,
we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation
opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not
be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to
do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty
as to the value of a target&rsquo;s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries
in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted
flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate
our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or
acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target
sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire
less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses
that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of NASDAQ&rsquo;s 80%
of fair market value test. There is no basis for investors in our initial public offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks
of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination.</P>

whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by
us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the
terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under
NASDAQ rules, asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with
our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek
to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure an initial
business combination with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether
to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed initial business combination. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder
vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements
or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we obtain and maintain a listing for

directors have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering
(including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of
seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, non-votes will have no effect on the approval
of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders&rsquo; founder
shares, we would need only 8,625,001, or 37.5%, of the 23,000,000 public shares sold in our initial public offering to be voted
in favor of an initial business combination (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to have our initial business
combination approved. We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written
notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum
and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate

in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed initial business combination may require:
(i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or
other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business
combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer
rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of
such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a &ldquo;group&rdquo; (as defined under
Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15%
of the shares sold in our initial public offering, which we refer to as the &ldquo;Excess Shares.&rdquo; Such restriction shall
also be applicable to our affiliates. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks
of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed
initial business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the
then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate
of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder&rsquo;s
shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms.
By limiting our stockholders&rsquo; ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in our initial public offering without
our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our
ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with an initial business combination with a target
that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting
our stockholders&rsquo; ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">We may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights,
whether they are record holders or hold their shares in &ldquo;street name,&rdquo; to either tender their certificates to our
transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents or proxy materials mailed to such holders, or up to two
business days prior to the initial vote on the proposal to approve the initial business combination in the event we distribute
proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company&rsquo;s DWAC
(Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder&rsquo;s option. The tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, that
we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are
requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder
must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send
out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the vote on the initial
business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its
redemption rights. Given the relatively short exercise period, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of
their public shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the
act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering
broker $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee
would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares.
The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must
be effectuated.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In
order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute
proxy materials for the stockholders&rsquo; vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a
proposed initial business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or
her redemption rights. After the initial business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange
for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an &ldquo;option window&rdquo;
after the completion of the initial business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company&rsquo;s
stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before
actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders
were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become &ldquo;option&rdquo; rights surviving past the completion
of the initial business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic
delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder&rsquo;s election to redeem is irrevocable once the initial business
combination is approved.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the
date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable.
Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently
decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent
return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public
shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only
18 months from the closing of our initial public offering to complete our initial business combination. If we are unable to complete
our initial business combination within such 18-month period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding
up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share
price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest
to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish
public stockholders&rsquo; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any),
subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of
our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware
law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating
distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the 18-month time period.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant
to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares
held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering.
However, if our sponsor, officers or directors acquire public shares in or after our initial public offering, they will be entitled
to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business
combination within the allotted 18-month time period.</P>

18 months from the closing of our initial public offering or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders&rsquo;
rights or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem
their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate
amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously
released to us to pay our franchise and income taxes divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may
not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation
of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters&rsquo; fees and commissions (so that we are not subject
to the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive
number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement (described above), we would not proceed
with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time.</P>

as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the $493,128 of proceeds held outside the trust
account (as of December 31, 2019), although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. We will
depend on sufficient interest being earned on the proceeds held in the trust account to pay any tax obligations we may owe. However,
if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the
extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay taxes on interest income earned on the trust
account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to
pay those costs and expenses.</P>

sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account
interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would
be approximately $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors
which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption
amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.00. Under Section 281(b) of the General Corporation Law
of Delaware, as amended (the &ldquo;DGCL&rdquo;), our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in
full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid
or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts,

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers, prospective target businesses
or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind
in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will
execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the
trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims,
as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim
against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving
such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to
it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third
party&rsquo;s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where
we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third-party consultant whose particular
expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to
execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Marcum LLP, our
independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of the offering will not execute agreements with us waiving
such claims to the monies held in the trust account.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims
they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not
seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent
any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have
entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount
of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held
in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in
the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party
or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or
not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public
offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to
reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy
its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor&rsquo;s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot
assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers, directors or members of our sponsor
will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.</P>

account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to
pay taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification
obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our
sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal
action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent
directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed
by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that
a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot
assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of
creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share.</P>

within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law.
If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable
provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against
the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting
period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating
distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&rsquo;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the

such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legal proceedings that a party may
bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations
for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the
case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing
of our initial public offering, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably

Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly
or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than
we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation
gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay
cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us
for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not
be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully
negotiating an initial business combination.</P>

business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing
the target business. In all likelihood, these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled
to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential targets we may conduct
an initial business combination with because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose
such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential business combination candidate
will have financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP or that the potential target business will be able to prepare
its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met,

procedures audited. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy
of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination. Prior to the date of the final prospectus

carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Report, before making a decision
to invest in our units. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially
adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.</I></P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">We are a newly formed company with no operating results, and we will not commence operations
until obtaining funding through our initial public offering. Because we lack an operating history, you have no basis upon which
to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination with one or more target
businesses. We have no plans, arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning an initial business
combination and may be unable to complete our initial business combination. If we fail to complete our initial business combination,
we will never generate any operating revenues.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">We may choose not to hold a stockholder vote to approve our initial business combination
unless the initial business combination would require stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirements
or if we decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons. Except as required by law, the decision as to
whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their
shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors, such as
the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval.
Accordingly, we may complete our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of our public shares do not approve
of the initial business combination we complete.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">Pursuant to the letter agreement, our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to
vote their founder shares, as well as any public shares purchased during or after our initial public offering (including in open
market and privately negotiated transactions), in favor of our initial business combination. As a result, in addition to our initial
stockholders&rsquo; founder shares, we would need only 8,625,001, or 37.5%, of the 23,000,000 public shares sold in our initial
public offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) in order to
have our initial business combination approved. Our initial stockholders own shares representing 20% of our outstanding shares
of common stock immediately following the completion of our initial public offering. Accordingly, if we seek stockholder approval
of our initial business combination, the agreement by our initial stockholders to vote in favor of our initial business combination
will increase the likelihood that we will receive the requisite stockholder approval for such initial business combination.</P>

in which we describe our initial business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0"><B>The ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our
financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets, which may make it difficult for us to enter into an
initial business combination with a target.</B></P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">We may seek to enter into an initial business combination agreement with a prospective
target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing condition and, as a result, would not be able to proceed
with the initial business combination. Furthermore, in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause
our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of
underwriters&rsquo; fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC&rsquo;s &ldquo;penny stock&rdquo; rules) or any
greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination.
Consequently, if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001
upon consummation of our initial business combination and after payment of underwriters&rsquo; fees and commissions or such greater
amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above, we would not proceed with such redemption and the related
business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these
risks and, thus, may be reluctant to enter into an initial business combination with us.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0"><B>The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect
to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure.</B></P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">At the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination, we will
not know how many stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, and therefore will need to structure the transaction based
on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initial business combination agreement
requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amount
of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such requirements, or arrange for
third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected, we may
need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third party financing.
Raising additional third party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than
desirable levels. Furthermore, this dilution would increase to the extent that the anti-dilution provisions of the Class B common
stock result in the issuance of Class A shares on a greater than one-to-one basis upon conversion of the Class B common stock
at the time of our business combination. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business
combination available to us or optimize our capital structure. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to
the underwriters will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed in connection with an initial business combination. The
per-share amount we will distribute to stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights will not be reduced by the deferred
underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the per-share value of shares held by non-redeeming stockholders will reflect
our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commissions.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0"><B>The ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">If our initial business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash

our initial business combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial business combination is unsuccessful, you
would not receive your pro rata portion of the trust account until we liquidate the trust account. If you are in need of immediate
liquidity, you could attempt to sell your stock in the open market; however, at such time our stock may trade at a discount to
the pro rata amount per share in the trust account. In either situation, you may suffer a material loss on your investment or
lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or you are able to sell your stock in
the open market.</P>

China, which has and is continuing to spread throughout China and other parts of the world, including the United States. On January
30, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a &ldquo;Public Health Emergency
of International Concern.&rdquo; On January 31, 2020, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex M. Azar II declared a public
health emergency for the United States to aid the U.S. healthcare community in responding to COVID-19, and on March 11, 2020 the
World Health Organization characterized the outbreak as a &ldquo;pandemic&rdquo;. A significant outbreak of COVID-19 and other
infectious diseases could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect the economies and financial markets
worldwide, and the business of any potential target business with which we consummate a business combination could be materially
and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete a business combination if continued concerns relating to COVID-19
restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company&rsquo;s personnel, vendors
and services providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner. The extent to which COVID-19
impacts our search for a business combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted,
including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its
impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period
of time, our ability to consummate a business combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate
a business combination, may be adversely affected in a material way.</P>

its shares. In addition, proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public
shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in
order to validly tender or redeem public shares, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself.
For example, we may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders
or hold their shares in &ldquo;street name,&rdquo; to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date
set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the initial vote on the proposal
to approve the initial business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer
agent electronically. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these or any other procedures, its shares may not be
redeemed. See the section of this prospectus entitled &ldquo;Item 1. Business &mdash; Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders

be at least $5.0 million and we would be required to have a minimum of 300 round lot holders of our securities. We cannot assure

prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referred to as &ldquo;covered securities.&rdquo;
Because our units, Class A common stock and warrants are listed on NASDAQ, our units, Class A common stock and warrants are covered
securities. Although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, the federal statute does allow the states
to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, then the states
can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used these powers
to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securities
regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale
of securities of blank check companies in their states. Further, if we were no longer listed on NASDAQ, our securities would not
be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities, including in connection
with our initial business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">Since the net proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination with a target business that has not been identified,
we may be deemed to be a &ldquo;blank check&rdquo; company under the United States securities laws. However, because we will have
net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 upon the successful completion of our initial public offering and the sale of the
private placement warrants and will file a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact,
we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly,
investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our units will have
a longer period of time to complete our initial business combination than do companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, if our initial
public offering were subject to Rule 419, that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust
account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial
business combination.</P>

be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our initial public
offering without our prior consent, which we refer to as the &ldquo;Excess Shares.&rdquo; However, we would not be restricting
our stockholders&rsquo; ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
Your inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce your influence over our ability to complete our initial business combination
and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us if you sell Excess Shares in open market transactions. Additionally,
you will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares if we complete our initial business combination.
And as a result, you will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15% and, in order to dispose of such shares, would

having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships),
other blank check companies and other entities competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals
and entities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions
of companies operating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess similar technical, human
and other resources to ours, and our financial resources are relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors.
While we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target
businesses that are sizableare limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others
an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses. Furthermore, because we are obligated to pay cash for the
shares of Class A common stock which our public stockholders redeem in connection with our initial business combination, target
companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination. This may place
us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination. If we are unable to complete our
initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.00 per share on the liquidation of our
trust account and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public stockholders may receive less than

of the trust account will be sufficient to allow us to operate for 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering;
however, we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate. Of the funds available to us, we could use a portion of the funds
available to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also use a portion of
the funds as a down payment or to fund a &ldquo;no-shop&rdquo; provision (a provision in letters of intent or merger agreements
designed to keep target businesses from &ldquo;shopping&rdquo; around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable
to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed initial business combination, although we do not have any current
intention to do so. If we entered into a letter of intent or merger agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity
from a target business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise),
we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence with respect to, a target business. If

other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate. None of our sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their
affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances. Any such advances would be repaid only from funds
held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000
of such loans may be convertible into private placement-equivalent warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the
lender. Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our
sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver
against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account. If we are unable to obtain these loans, we may be unable

have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account. Consequently, our
public stockholders may only receive approximately $10.00 per share on our redemption of our public shares, and our warrants will

we cannot assure you that this diligence will surface all material issues that may be present inside a particular target business,
that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside
of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later
write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting
losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks
may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items
and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative
market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other
covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining
debt financing to partially finance the initial business combination. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders
following the initial business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such stockholders are unlikely
to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach
by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring
a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the initial
business combination constituted an actionable material misstatement or omission.</P>

held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements, or even if
they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account, including, but not limited
to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability
of the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in

our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third

our initial business combination, we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that
may be brought against us within the 10 years following redemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public
stockholders could be less than the $10.00 per share initially held in the trust account, due to claims of such creditors. Our
sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products
sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar
agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00
per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the
trust account, if less than $10.00 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided
that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any
and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims
under our indemnity of the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under
the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently
verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor&rsquo;s only
assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations.
None of our officers, directors or members of our sponsor will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation,
claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.</P>

unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting
or trading in securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading &ldquo;investment
securities&rdquo; constituting more than 40% of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an
unconsolidated basis. Our business is to identify and complete an initial business combination and thereafter to operate the post-transaction
business or assets for the long term. We do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale.
We do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or to be a passive investor.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">We do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the Investment
Company Act. To this end, the proceeds held in the trust account may only be invested in United States &ldquo;government securities&rdquo;
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations. Pursuant to the trust agreement, the trustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or
assets. By restricting the investment of the proceeds to these instruments, and by having a business plan targeted at acquiring
and growing businesses for the long term (rather than on buying and selling businesses in the manner of a merchant bank or private
equity fund), we intend to avoid being deemed an &ldquo;investment company&rdquo; within the meaning of the Investment Company
Act. Our securities are not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities or investment
securities. The trust account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of: (i) the completion of
our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder
vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our

combination activity; or (iii) absent an initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public
offering, our return of the funds held in the trust account to our public stockholders as part of our redemption of the public
shares. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act. If
we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require
additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete an initial business combination
or may result in our liquidation. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination, our public stockholders may receive

within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law.
If a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable
provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against
the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting
period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating
distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&rsquo;s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the
stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it
is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the 18th month from the closing of our initial
public offering in the event we do not complete our initial business combination and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with

us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims
or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10 years following our dissolution. However, because we are a
blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target
businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or
prospective target businesses. If our plan of distribution complies with Section 281(b) of the DGCL, any liability of stockholders
with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder&rsquo;s pro rata share of the claim or
the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would likely be barred after the third anniversary
of the dissolution. We cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As
such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more)
and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date. Furthermore, if the pro rata portion
of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete
our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of our initial public offering is not considered a liquidating
distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of
legal proceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174
of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution,

to do so on a cashless basis. In the event of an exercise on a cashless basis, a holder would pay the warrant exercise price by
surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of Class A common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the
product of the number of shares of Class A common stock underlying the warrants, multiplied by the excess of the &ldquo;fair market
value&rdquo; (as defined in the next sentence) over the exercise price of the warrants by (y) the fair market value. The &ldquo;fair
market value&rdquo; is the average reported last sale price of the Class A common stock for the 10 trading days ending on the
third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of exercise is received by the warrant agent or on which the notice of
redemption is sent to the holders of warrants, as applicable. As a result, you would receive fewer shares of Class A common stock
from such exercise than if you were to exercise such warrants for cash.</P>

prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment, if such opportunity were available, in a business combination

a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless
they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or
other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy

us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
In addition, if stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">When evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with
a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business&rsquo; management may be limited due to a lack of time,
resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target&rsquo;s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect
and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target&rsquo;s management not possess
the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitability of the post-combination
business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following the initial business
combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction
in value.</P>

there have been no preliminary discussions concerning an initial business combination with any such entity or entities. Although
we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursue such a transaction
if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for an initial business combination as set forth in the section

shares for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.007 per share. In August 2019, the Company effected a stock
split resulting in an increase in the total number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding from 3,593,750 to 5,750,000, such
that the total number of founder shares would represent 20% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding upon completion
of our initial public offering. Subsequent to such stock split, in August 2019, our sponsor transferred 10,000 founder shares to
each of Mr. Bradley, our Chief Financial Officer, and Messrs. Gannon, Ginsberg and Mazer, our independent directors. These 40,000
shares are not be subject to forfeiture in the event the underwriters&rsquo; overallotment option is not exercised. The number
of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20% of the outstanding
shares after our initial public offering. The founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination.
In addition, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 6,100,000 at a price of $1.00 per warrant ($6,100,000 in the aggregate), that
will also be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination. Holders of founder shares have agreed (A) to vote
any shares owned by them in favor of any proposed initial business combination and (B) not to redeem any founder shares in connection
with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination. In addition, we may obtain loans from our sponsor,
affiliates of our sponsor or an officer or director. The personal and financial interests of our officers and directors may influence
their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination, completing an initial business combination and influencing
the operation of the business following the initial business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">We may structure an initial business combination so that the post-transaction company
in which our public stockholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business, but
we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding
voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required
to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that does not meet
such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders
prior to the initial business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company, depending
on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial business combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in
which we issue a substantial number of new shares of Class A common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock
of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial
number of new shares of common stock, our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of
our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction. In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently
combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the company&rsquo;s stock than we initially
acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the target
business. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of control of a target business, new management will possess the skills,
qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business.</P>

way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of an initial business combination since the warrants

and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard,
significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management&rsquo;s attention may be diverted from
other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may need to hire more employees in
the future or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses.</P>

financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances
and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses
we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such statements
in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.</P>

we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our
securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.</B></P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">We are an &ldquo;emerging growth company&rdquo; within the meaning of the Securities
Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are
applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required
to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding
executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding
advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As
a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth
company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value
of our Class A common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would
no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities
less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of
our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be
a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being
required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had
a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange
Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect
to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but
any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, which means
that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging
growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may
make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging
growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences
in accounting standards used.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0"><B>Compliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may make it more difficult for
us to effectuate our initial business combination, require substantial financial and management resources, and increase the time

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system
of internal controls beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2020. Only in the event we
are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to comply with the independent registered
public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. Further, for as long as we remain
an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation
requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with
the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target
company with which we seek to complete our initial business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance
with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; text-align: left; margin: 0pt 0">As of December 31, 2019, we had cash of $493,128 held outside the

perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses, travel to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of
prospective target businesses or their representatives or owners, review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective
target businesses, and structure, negotiate and complete a business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; text-align: left; margin: 0pt 0">In order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction
costs in connection with a business combination, the initial stockholders or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan
us funds as may be required. If we complete a business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that a business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts
but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into
warrants identical to the private placement warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; text-align: left; margin: 0pt 0">We do not believe we will need to raise additional funds in order
to meet the expenditures required for operating our business. However, if our estimate of the costs of identifying a target business,
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so,
we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination. Moreover, we may need to obtain
additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number
of our public shares upon consummation of our business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur
debt in connection with such business combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would only complete
such financing simultaneously with the completion of our business combination. If we are unable to complete our business combination
because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account.
In addition, following our business combination, if cash on hand is insufficient, we may need to obtain additional financing in
order to meet our obligations.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; text-align: left; margin: 0pt 0">The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the financial statements, and income and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ
from those estimates. We have identified the following critical accounting policies:</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; text-align: left; margin: 0pt 0">We account for common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance
with the guidance in Accounting Standards Codification (&ldquo;ASC&rdquo;) Topic 480 &ldquo;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.&rdquo;
Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally
redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder
or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within the Company&rsquo;s control) is classified
as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders&rsquo; equity. Our common stock features certain
redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly,
common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders&rsquo;
equity section of our balance sheet.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; text-align: left; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; text-align: left; margin: 0pt 0">We apply the two-class method in calculating earnings per share.
Common stock subject to possible redemption which is not currently redeemable and is not redeemable at fair value, has been excluded
from the calculation of basic net loss per common share since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share
of the trust account earnings. Our net income is adjusted for the portion of income that is attributable to common stock subject

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; text-align: left; margin: 0pt 0">Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies
from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that
have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under
the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a
company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth
companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period
which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies,
we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised
standard.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; text-align: left; margin: 0pt 0">Disclosure controls are procedures that are designed with the objective
of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act, such as this Report, is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time period specified in the SEC&rsquo;s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are
also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including
the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Our management evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer
(our &ldquo;Certifying Officers&rdquo;), the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2019,
pursuant to Rule&nbsp;13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Certifying Officers concluded that, as
of December 31, 2019, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; text-align: right; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; text-align: left; margin: 0pt 0">We do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will
prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated,
can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must
be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances
of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls and procedures also is based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood
of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential
future conditions.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">Commencing on the date our securities were first listed on NASDAQ, we have agreed to
pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support.
Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. In no event will
our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which our sponsor or officers are affiliated, be
paid any finder&rsquo;s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by
the company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion
of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, these individuals will be reimbursed
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses
and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. We do not have a policy that prohibits our sponsor, executive
officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses
by a target business. Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers or
directors, or our or their affiliates. Any such payments prior to an initial business combination will be made using funds held
outside the trust account. Other than quarterly audit committee review of such payments, we do not expect to have any additional
controls in place governing our reimbursement payments to our directors and executive officers for their out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with identifying and consummating an initial business combination.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">After the completion of our initial business combination, directors or members of our
management team who remain with us may be paid consulting or management fees from the combined company. All of these fees will
be fully disclosed to stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials furnished
to our stockholders in connection with a proposed initial business combination. We have not established any limit on the amount
of such fees that may be paid by the combined company to our directors or members of management. It is unlikely the amount of
such compensation will be known at the time of the proposed initial business combination, because the directors of the post-combination
business will be responsible for determining officer and director compensation. Any compensation to be paid to our officers will
be determined, or recommended to the board of directors for determination, either by a compensation committee constituted solely
by independent directors or by a majority of the independent directors on our board of directors.</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">We do not intend to take any action to ensure that members of our management team maintain
their positions with us after the consummation of our initial business combination, although it is possible that some or all of
our officers and directors may negotiate employment or consulting arrangements to remain with us after our initial business combination.
The existence or terms of any such employment or consulting arrangements to retain their positions with us may influence our management&rsquo;s
motivation in identifying or selecting a target business but we do not believe that the ability of our management to remain with
us after the consummation of our initial business combination will be a determining factor in our decision to proceed with any
potential business combination. We are not party to any agreements with our officers and directors that provide for benefits upon
termination of employment.</P>

to our sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 in cash, or approximately $0.007 per share. In August 2019, the Company
effected a stock split resulting in an increase in the total number of shares of Class B common stock outstanding from 3,593,750
to 5,750,000, such that the total number of founder shares would represent 20% of the total number of shares of common stock outstanding
upon completion of our initial public offering. Subsequent to such stock split, in August 2019, our sponsor transferred 10,000
founder shares to each of Mr. Bradley, our Chief Financial Officer, and Messrs. Gannon, Ginsberg and Mazer, our independent directors.
These 40,000 shares are not be subject to forfeiture in the event the underwriters&rsquo; overallotment option is not exercised.
The number of founder shares issued was determined based on the expectation that such founder shares would represent 20% of the
outstanding shares upon completion of our initial public offering. The founder shares (including the Class A common stock issuable
upon exercise thereof) may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by the holder.</P>

an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). We do not have a policy that prohibits our
sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, from negotiating for the reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses by a target business. Our audit committee reviews on a quarterly basis all payments that were made to our sponsor, officers,
directors or our or their affiliates and will determine which expenses and the amount of expenses that will be reimbursed. There

<P STYLE="font-size: 10pt; margin: 0pt 0">In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial
business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated
to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete an initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts. In the
event that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust
account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment. Up to $1,500,000
of such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would
be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. The terms
of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to
such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe
third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our
trust account.</P>

us may be paid consulting, management or other fees from the combined company with any and all amounts being fully disclosed to
our stockholders, to the extent then known, in the tender offer or proxy solicitation materials, as applicable, furnished to our
stockholders. It is unlikely the amount of such compensation will be known at the time of distribution of such tender offer materials
or at the time of a stockholder meeting held to consider our initial business combination, as applicable, as it will be up to
the directors of the post-combination business to determine executive and director compensation.</P>

assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company
is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of
our audit we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing
an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such
opinion.</P>

performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud,
and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

&ldquo;Company&rdquo;) is a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on May 28, 2019. The Company was formed for the purpose
of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination
with one or more businesses (the &ldquo;Business Combination&rdquo;).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">As of December 31, 2019, the Company had
not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from May 28, 2019 (inception) through December 31, 2019 relates to the
Company&rsquo;s formation, the initial public offering (&ldquo;Initial Public Offering&rdquo;), which is described below, and,
after the Initial Public Offering, identifying a target company for a Business Combination. The Company will not generate any
operating revenues until after the completion of its initial Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company will generate
non-operating income in the form of interest income from the proceeds derived from the Initial Public Offering.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The registration statement for the Company&rsquo;s
Initial Public Offering was declared effective on September 10, 2019. On September 13, 2019, the Company consummated the Initial
Public Offering of 20,000,000 units (the &ldquo;Units&rdquo; and, with respect to the shares of Class A common stock included
in the Units sold, the &ldquo;Public Shares&rdquo;), generating gross proceeds of $200,000,000, which is described in Note 3.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Simultaneously with the closing of the
Initial Public Offering, the Company consummated the sale of 5,500,000 warrants (the &ldquo;Private Placement Warrants&rdquo;)
at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant in a private placement to New Providence Management LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the &ldquo;Sponsor&rdquo;), generating gross proceeds of $5,500,000, which is described in Note 4.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0 0pt 69.85pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 20.15pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Following the closing of the Initial Public
Offering on September 13, 2019, an amount of $200,000,000 ($10.00 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in
the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the &ldquo;Trust Account&rdquo;)
and invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act, with
a maturity of 185&nbsp;days or less or in any open-ended investment company that holds itself out as a money market fund selected
by the Company meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the &ldquo;Investment Company
Act&rdquo;), as determined by the Company, until the earlier of: (i)&nbsp;the completion of a Business Combination or (ii) the
distribution of the Trust Account to the Company&rsquo;s stockholders, as described below.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">On September 19, 2019, in connection with
the underwriters&rsquo; election to fully exercise their over-allotment option, the Company consummated the sale of an additional
3,000,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit and the sale of an additional 600,000 Private Placement Warrants at $1.00 per Private Placement
Warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $30,600,000. Following the closing, an additional $30,000,000 of net proceeds was
deposited into the Trust Account, resulting in $230,000,000 held in the Trust Account.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Transaction costs incurred in connection
with the Initial Public Offering amounted to $13,260,927, consisting of $4,600,000 of underwriting fees, $8,050,000 of deferred
underwriting fees and $610,927 of other offering costs. As of December 31, 2019, cash of $493,128 was held outside of the Trust
Account and was available for working capital purposes.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Company&rsquo;s management has broad
discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private
Placement Warrants, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a
Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The
Company must complete an initial Business Combination having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held
in the Trust Account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable) at the time of the agreement to enter
into the initial Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns
or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the
target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended (the &ldquo;Investment Company Act&rdquo;).</P>

with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i)
in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision
as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the
Company, solely in its discretion. The stockholders will be entitled to redeem their shares for a pro rata portion of the amount
then in the Trust Account (initially $10.00 per share), plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account
and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations. The per-share amount to be distributed to stockholders
who redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions the Company will pay to the underwriters
(as discussed in Note 6). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the
Company&rsquo;s warrants.</P>

Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or
other legal reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, conduct the redemptions
pursuant to the tender offer rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (&ldquo;SEC&rdquo;) and file tender offer documents
containing substantially the same information as would be included in a proxy statement with the SEC prior to completing a Business
Combination. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Company&rsquo;s Sponsor
has agreed to vote its Founder Shares (as defined in Note 5) and any Public Shares purchased by it during or after the Initial
Public Offering in favor of approving a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their
Public Shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against a Business Combination.</P>

or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a &ldquo;group&rdquo; (as defined under Section&nbsp;13
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &ldquo;Exchange Act&rdquo;)), will be restricted from seeking redemption

Combination and (b)&nbsp;not to propose an amendment to the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would affect
the substance or timing of the Company&rsquo;s obligation to redeem 100% of its Public Shares if the Company does not complete
a Business Combination, unless the Company provides the public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their Public Shares
in conjunction with any such amendment.</P>

as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares,
at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest
earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its taxes (less up to $100,000
of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely
extinguish public stockholders&rsquo; rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions,
if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval
of the Company&rsquo;s remaining stockholders and the Company&rsquo;s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each
case to the Company&rsquo;s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable
law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to the Company&rsquo;s warrants, which will
expire worthless if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.</P>

However, the Sponsor will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to any Public Shares purchased
by it during or after the Initial Public Offering if the Company fails to complete its Business Combination. The underwriters
have agreed to waive their rights to their deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event the Company
does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with
the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution,
it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public
Offering price per Unit ($10.00).</P>

liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company,
or a prospective target business with which the Company has entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar
agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amounts in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per Public
Share and (ii) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account,
if less than $10.00 per Public Share due to reductions in the value of trust assets, provided that such liability will not apply
to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in
the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the Company&rsquo;s indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public
Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &ldquo;Securities
Act&rdquo;). In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be
responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the
Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers
(except the Company&rsquo;s independent registered accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which
the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to
monies held in the Trust Account.</P>

The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that
apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out
of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates
for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time
private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company&rsquo;s financial statements with
another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using
the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.</P>

in conformity with GAAP requires the Company&rsquo;s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts

exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or
set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate,
could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly
from those estimates.</P>

480 &ldquo;Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.&rdquo; Common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability
instrument and is measured at fair value. Conditionally redeemable common stock (including common stock that features redemption
rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely
within the Company&rsquo;s control) is classified as temporary equity. At all other times, common stock is classified as stockholders&rsquo;
equity. The Company&rsquo;s common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of the Company&rsquo;s
control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events. Accordingly, common stock subject to possible redemption is presented
at redemption value as temporary equity, outside of the stockholders&rsquo; equity section of the Company&rsquo;s balance sheet.

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">The Company follows the asset and liability
method of accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, &ldquo;Income Taxes.&rdquo; Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the&nbsp;years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.
The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that included
the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established, when necessary, to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected
to be realized.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">ASC 740 prescribes a recognition threshold
and a measurement attribute for the financial statements recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination
by taxing authorities. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax
expense. There were no unrecognized tax benefits and no amounts accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2019. The
Company is currently not aware of any issues under review that could result in significant payments, accruals or material deviation
from its position. The Company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities since inception.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0; text-align: justify">Net loss per share is computed by dividing
net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company applies the two-class
method in calculating earnings per share. Shares of common stock subject to possible redemption at December 31, 2019, which are
not currently redeemable and are not redeemable at fair value, have been excluded from the calculation of basic loss per share
since such shares, if redeemed, only participate in their pro rata share of the Trust Account earnings. The Company has not considered
the effect of warrants sold in the Initial Public Offering and private placement to purchase an aggregate of 17,600,000 shares
of common stock. As a result, diluted loss per common share is the same as basic loss per common share for the periods.</P>
